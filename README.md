# No Scroll

No Scroll is a JavaScript utility for disabling and re-enabling scroll without causing layout shift. It works by displaying a pseudo element to occupy the space created on some devices when removing the scrollbar. The script will first detect the amount of space the scrollbar takes up so it will also work on devices with overlay scrollbars that don't take up space.

## Installation

### Option 1: Install using NPM
